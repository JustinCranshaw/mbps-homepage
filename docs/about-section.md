## About Mount Baker Preschool

### Headline
A Waldorf cooperative where children learn through play, nature, and community.

### Subhead
We nurture the whole child—body, mind, and soul—through loving guidance, imaginative play, and a predictable daily rhythm.

### Body copy
Mount Baker Preschool is a warm, inclusive Waldorf cooperative for children ages 3–5. Our teachers lead with songs, stories, handwork, and outdoor adventures; parents partner with them to create a caring, home‑like environment. Each day flows between free play, time in nature, nourishing food, and gentle group moments like circle time and storytelling.

Rooted in reverence for childhood, we emphasize natural materials, seasonal rhythms, empathy, and community. Children climb, jump, sew, paint, garden, and explore—developing coordination, curiosity, and confidence through purposeful play.

### What guides us
- **Love and warmth**: relationships come first.
- **Free, imaginative play**: the seedbed of creativity.
- **Care for the environment**: connection to the living world.
- **Gratitude, reverence, and wonder**: a joyful rhythm to the day.

### What families experience
Daily outdoor time, tending our pea patch, seasonal celebrations (lantern walk, winter spiral, kite day, and the spring maypole), and a welcoming community committed to dignity and respect for all families.

- **Recommended alt**: “Children dancing around a maypole with colorful ribbons on a spring day.”
- **Caption (optional)**: “Spring maypole celebration at Mount Baker Preschool.”
- **Usage**: Photo‑forward layout with the image occupying at least 50% of the section. Place copy in a `text-backdrop` card for contrast. Favor a 16:9 or 4:3 crop that keeps the ribbons and faces within the central third. Avoid heavy color filters; let the natural greens and ribbon colors shine.
